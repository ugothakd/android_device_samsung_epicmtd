##This is a quick tutorial on building an ota package for Samsung Epic using ##the CyanogenMod Android repo.

This tutorial begins with a belief that you have already sync'd down CyanogenMod sources and have set up your build environment.

The first thing that will need to be done, is that you will need to create a local_manifest.xml for the EpicCM device and to override cyanogen vendor.

-------BEGIN-----------

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <manifest>

    <remote  name="EpicCM" fetch="https://github.com" />

    <project path="device/samsung/epicmtd" name="EpicCM/android_device_samsung_epicmtd" remote="EpicCM" revision="blob-overlay"/>
    <project path="vendor/cyanogen" name="EpicCM/android_vendor_cyanogen" remote="EpicCM" revision="epiccm-rebase"/>

  </manifest>

-------EOF------------

To set up the vendor tree, you'll need to cd to device/samsung/epicmtd:

1. Run extract-files.sh while phone is connected via usb to pull proprietaries from device. The script will then call setup-makefiles to generate vendor/samsung/epicmtd/ and the necessary makefiles for blob manipulation

2. Next, from the root android directory, you'll need to:
	repo sync
	make clobber
	brunch epicmtd

and the build will begin!

At the end of the compile, the generate ota package will be in out/target/product/epicmtd/
